# CSC2014-Assignment
Video and image editing assignment for CSC2014 at Sunway University using python and OpenCV

Task A: YouTube Video Processing (12.5%)
One of your friends has just started to work as a YouTuber for a week. She has captured some random 
videos from different places. Since you are currently taking a course related to image processing, she has 
requested your help to develop a program that can be used to perform the following.
1) Blur all the faces that appear in the following videos automatically.
a. street.mp4 (1280 x 720 @ 30 frames per second)
b. exercise.mp4 (1920 x 1080 @ 30 frames per second)
c. office.mp4 (1920 x 1080 @ 30 frames per second)
2) Resize and overlay the video that she talks about her life as a YouTuber (talking.mp4) on the top left 
corner of each video.
3) Add different watermarks (watermark1.png and watermark2.png) to the videos to protect them from 
being stolen.


Task B: Paragraphs Extraction (12.5%)
One of your seniors is currently working on the literature review for his final year project. He has collected 
a set of one-page scientific papers with different formatting (single-column, double-column and triplecolumn) from the Internet. His final year project is about analysing the writing style of different authors. 
He has requested your help to (i) identify and extract all the paragraphs from the papers he collected, (ii) 
sort them in the correct order (required for double-column and triple-column papers), and (iii) ignore 
tables in the papers (i.e. do not extract the tables).
Knowing that you are currently taking a course related to image processing, he has converted all the 
papers to images(001.png to 008.png) for you to apply different image processing techniques you learned 
for the course
